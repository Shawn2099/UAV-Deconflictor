🚀 SkyGuard: Your Personal Air Traffic Controller<p align="center"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gemini-prod/images/d8f63548-a021-4a1d-9e90-36074a38345c.gif" alt="SkyGuard in Action" width="80%"></p><p align="center"><i>Ever tried to throw a paper airplane in a room full of other paper airplanes? It's chaos!</i><br><b>SkyGuard is the tool that makes sure your drone isn't that paper airplane.</b></p>🤔 So, What's the Big Idea?Imagine a busy sky, buzzing with drones delivering packages, taking photos, and surveying land. Now, you want to launch your own drone on a mission. How do you make sure it doesn't cause a mid-air traffic jam?That's where SkyGuard comes in. It's a strategic deconfliction system that acts as a final "Go/No-Go" authority. Before you take off, you show SkyGuard your flight plan, and it looks into the future to see if you'll get too close to any other drone, checking for conflicts in both space and time.✨ Core Features: What's in the Box?🔮 Crystal Ball: Sees the future flight paths of all drones and predicts potential conflicts before they happen.🗺️ 3D Mission Command: An interactive 3D interface where you can watch the entire airspace live and visually plan your mission.🚦 Instant Traffic Light: Get a simple "CLEAR" or "CONFLICT" status for your planned mission in seconds.🎯 Laser-Point Accuracy: If a conflict is found, it doesn't just wave a red flag. It pinpoints the exact location and time of the potential incident and shows you on the map.🕹️ Getting Started: Your First FlightReady to take control? Getting SkyGuard running is a breeze.Clone the MothershipGet the project code onto your local machine.Assemble Your ToolsOpen a terminal in the project folder and run this command to install all the necessary Python libraries from our list.pip install -r requirements.txt
Power Up the EngineTo launch the interactive web UI, run the server.py script. This starts the backend brain.python server.py

The Automation Tool (main.py)For developers and automation, main.py provides a way to run checks without the UI. It's controlled with command-line arguments:--scenarios [FILE_PATH]: Specify a custom scenario file to run.--config [FILE_PATH]: Use a different configuration file.--visualize: A fun extra! Add this flag, and the script will generate a .gif animation of the scenario it just checked.Example Command:python main.py --scenarios data/my_test_mission.json --visualize
