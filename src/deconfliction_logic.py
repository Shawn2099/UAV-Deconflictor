[V9 - Hybrid Engine with Robust Parallel/Collinear Geometry]
This module implements a highly scalable, two-phase deconfliction engine. It uses a coarse 4D grid to first filter for potential
threats and then runs a precise analytical check on the filtered candidates.
The get_closest_points_and_distance_3d function has been patched to correctly handle parallel and collinear segment edge cases.
